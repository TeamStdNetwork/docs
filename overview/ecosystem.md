# Std Ecosystem Overview

The Std ecosystem is a collection of related projects
maintained under different accounts, each with a clear
and well-defined responsibility.

This separation ensures scalability, clarity,
and long-term sustainability.

## Primary Accounts

### 1. STD-DEEPANSHU

STD-DEEPANSHU is the primary and authoritative account
of the ecosystem.

It maintains:
- StdAPI (a unified API platform)
- Programming learning roadmaps
- Cybersecurity and ethical hacking roadmaps

StdAPI is developed and versioned as a repository
under STD-DEEPANSHU and serves as the core technical product.

This account focuses on logic, tooling,
and long-term technical knowledge.

### 2. StdBots

StdBots contains practical bot implementations.

It includes:

These bots may consume StdAPI but do not expose
or maintain core backend logic.

and end-user interaction.

### 3. TeamStdNetwork

TeamStdNetwork represents the public-facing layer
of the ecosystem.

It maintains:
