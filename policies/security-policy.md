# Security Policy

Security is treated as a priority across
all projects within the Std ecosystem.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest stable versions of projects
are actively maintained and supported.

Users are encouraged to keep dependencies
and integrations up to date.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue,
please report it responsibly.

Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly
before they have been reviewed and addressed.

Security reports should include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact

## Responsible Disclosure

All reports will be reviewed in good faith.
Reasonable efforts will be made to address
confirmed vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

Public disclosure should occur only after
a fix or mitigation has been implemented.
