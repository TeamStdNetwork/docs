# StdAPI — Design Principles

StdAPI is built around a small set of core principles.

## Practical First

Modules are added only if they solve
real, recurring problems.

## Lightweight by Design

The platform avoids heavy dependencies,
large assets, or bundled binaries.

## Consistency

Responses follow predictable structures
to simplify client-side integration.

## Long-Term Stability

Breaking changes are avoided whenever possible.
The focus is on steady, maintainable growth.
