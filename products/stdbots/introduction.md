# StdBots — Introduction

StdBots contains Telegram and WhatsApp bots
maintained as part of the Std ecosystem.

These bots:
- Demonstrate practical usage of StdAPI
- Focus on end-user interaction
- Are developed as independent repositories

StdBots does not host core backend logic.
Its purpose is application and usage,
not infrastructure.
