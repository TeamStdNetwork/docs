# Web and App Showcases

TeamStdNetwork maintains selected web
and app projects for demonstration and portfolio purposes.

These projects focus on:
- User interface design
- Application flow
- Integration concepts

They are not intended to expose
core backend logic or production secrets.

The goal is to showcase possibilities,
not implementation details.
